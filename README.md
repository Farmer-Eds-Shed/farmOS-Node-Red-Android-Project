# farmOS-Node-Red-Android-Project

This project is being built on Node-Red running directly on an Android Device https://nodered.org/docs/getting-started/android.
This will make some flows available "off-line" and also allow easy integration with farm equipment such as tractors/implements, cattle RFID readers and scales.

### Current Features:
1. Inventory usage tracking.

### In Progress
1. Bale recording direct from baler counter
